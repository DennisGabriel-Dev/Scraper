# Scraper
## For you run this project, follow this:
<br>
This project was made first at ruby 3.2.2 version :) maybe something breaks, case you use older version it.<br>
<br>
In your terminal type: <br>
<pre>
  gem install nokogiri
  gem install httparty
  gem install parallel
</pre>
<br>
note: csv is a Ruby's default gem, so you don't need install this.<br>
<br>
Finally, type and run: <br>
<pre>
  ruby scraper.rb 
</pre>
